	abstract = {We present a numerical parameter survey of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) explosions. Carbon–oxygen WDs accreting a helium shell have the potential to explode in the sub-Chandrasekhar mass regime. Previous studies have shown how the ignition of a helium shell can either directly ignite the WD at the core–shell interface or propagate a shock wave into the the core causing a central ignition. We examine the explosions of WDs from 0.6 to 1.2 Me with helium shells of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.08 Me. Distinct observational signatures of subChandrasekhar mass WD explosions are predicted for two categories of shell size. Thicker-shell models show an early time ﬂux excess, which is caused by the presence of radioactive material in the ashes of the helium shell, and red colors due to these ashes creating signiﬁcant line blanketing in the UV through the blue portion of the spectrum. Thin shell models reproduce several typical Type Ia supernova signatures. We identify a relationship between Si II velocity and luminosity that, for the ﬁrst time, identiﬁes a subclass of observed supernovae that are consistent with these models. This subclass is further delineated by the absence of carbon in their atmospheres. We suggest that the proposed difference in the ratio of selective to total extinction between the high velocity and normal velocity Type Ia supernovae is not due to differences in the properties of the dust around these events, but is rather an artifact of applying a single extinction correction to two intrinsically different populations of supernovae.},

	abstract = {We use non-local thermal equilibrium radiative transport modeling to examine observational signatures of subChandrasekhar mass double detonation explosions in the nebular phase. Results range from spectra that look like typical and subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe) for higher mass progenitors to spectra that look like Ca-rich transients for lower mass progenitors. This ignition mechanism produces an inherent relationship between emission features and the progenitor mass as the ratio of the nebular [Ca II]/[Fe III] emission lines increases with decreasing white dwarf mass. Examining the [Ca II]/[Fe III] nebular line ratio in a sample of observed SNe we ﬁnd further evidence for the two distinct classes of SNe Ia identiﬁed in Polin et al. by their relationship between Si II velocity and B-band magnitude, both at time of peak brightness. This suggests that SNe Ia arise from more than one progenitor channel, and provides an empirical method for classifying events based on their physical origin. Furthermore, we provide insight to the mysterious origin of Ca-rich transients. Low-mass double detonation models with only a small mass fraction of Ca (1\%) produce nebular spectra that cool primarily through forbidden [Ca II] emission.},

	abstract = {Manganese abundances are sensitive probes of the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this work, we present a catalog of manganese abundances in dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way, measured using medium-resolution spectroscopy. Using a simple chemical evolution model, we infer the manganese yield of SNe Ia in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) and compare to theoretical yields. The sub-solar yield from SNe Ia ([Mn Fe]Ia = -0.30-+00..0033 at [Fe/ H]=−1.5 dex, with negligible dependence on metallicity) implies that subChandrasekhar-mass (sub-MCh) white dwarf progenitors are the dominant channel of SNe Ia at early times in this galaxy, although some fraction (20\%) of MCh Type Ia or Type Iax SNe are still needed to produce the observed yield. First-order corrections for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium increase the inferred [Mn Fe]Ia by as much as ∼0.3 dex. However, our results also suggest that the nucleosynthetic source of SNe Ia may depend on environment. In particular, we ﬁnd that dSphs with extended star formation histories (Leo I, Fornax dSphs) appear to have higher [Mn/Fe] at a given metallicity than galaxies with early bursts of star formation (Sculptor dSph), suggesting that MCh progenitors may become the dominant channel of SNe Ia at later times in a galaxy’s chemical evolution.},

	abstract = {The detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf (WD) has been proposed as a possible explosion triggering mechanism for SNe Ia. Here, we report ZTF 18aaqeasu (SN 2018byg/ATLAS 18pqq), a peculiar Type I supernova, consistent with being a helium-shell double-detonation. With a rise time of ≈18 days from explosion, the transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of MR≈−18.2 mag, exhibiting a light curve akin to sub-luminous SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia, albeit with an unusually steep increase in brightness within a week from explosion. Spectra taken near peak light exhibit prominent Si absorption features together with an unusually red color (g − r≈2 mag) arising from nearly complete line blanketing of ﬂux blueward of 5000 Å. This behavior is unlike any previously observed thermonuclear transient. Nebular phase spectra taken at and after ≈30 days from peak light reveal evidence of a thermonuclear detonation event dominated by Fe-group nucleosynthesis. We show that the peculiar properties of ZTF 18aaqeasu are consistent with the detonation of a massive (≈0.15 M) helium shell on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (≈0.75 M) WD after including mixing of ≈0.2 M of material in the outer ejecta. These observations provide evidence of a likely rare class of thermonuclear supernovae arising from detonations of massive helium shells.},

We ﬁnd that SN2016hnk is intrinsically red relative to typical thermonuclear SNe and has a relatively low peak luminosity ( MB=−15.4 mag), setting it apart from low-luminosity SNe Ia. SN2016hnk has a fast-rising light curve that is consistent with other Ca-rich transients (tr=15 days). We determine that SN2016hnk produced 0.03±0.01 Me of 56Ni and 0.9±0.3 Me of ejecta. The photospheric spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca II absorption and signiﬁcant line blanketing at λ{\textless}5000 Å, making it distinct from typical (SN 2005E-like) Ca-rich SNe. SN2016hnk is remarkably similar to SN2018byg, which was modeled as a He-shell double-detonation explosion. We demonstrate that the spectra and light curves of SN2016hnk are well modeled by the detonation of a 0.02 M helium shell on the surface of a 0.85 M C/O white dwarf. This analysis highlights the second observed case of a He-shell double-detonation and suggests a speciﬁc thermonuclear explosion that is physically distinct from SNe that are deﬁned simply by their low luminosities and strong [Ca II] emission.},

We describe the experiment design and spectroscopic completeness from the ﬁrst 16 months of operations, which have classiﬁed 754 supernovae. We present results from a systematic search for calcium-rich gap transients in the sample of 22 low-luminosity (peak absolute magnitude M{\textgreater}−17), hydrogen-poor events found in the experiment. We report the detection of eight new events, and constrain their volumetric rate to 15\%±5\% of the SN Ia rate. Combining this sample with 10 previously known events, we ﬁnd a likely continuum of spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia–like features (Ca-Ia objects) to those with SN Ib/c–like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the Ca-Ib/c events, we ﬁnd two populations distinguished by their red (g−r≈1.5 mag) or green (g - r » 0.5 mag) colors at the r-band peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing features and slower light curves (similar to Ca-Ia objects), weaker He lines, and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular phase. We ﬁnd that all together the spectroscopic continuum, volumetric rates, and striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He shells on low-mass white dwarfs. We suggest that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects arise from the double detonation of He shells, while green Ca-Ib/c objects are consistent with low-efﬁciency burning scenarios like detonations in lowdensity shells or deﬂagrations.},
